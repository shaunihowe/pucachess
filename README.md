# Puca Chess - By Shaun Howe

A rewrite of my chess program 'Menechess', while Menechess was just a way for me to learn C programming, Puca is a fully functioning chess program that I wrote around 2008.

Estimated rating is around 1550 elo.

Competed in the Chesswar XVII Promo group and finished 73rd out of 200 programs (6 wins, 5 losses) and also competed in Openwar 8th Edition and finished 67th out of 78 programs.

Only just decided to release because someone was asking about it, so here it is.
